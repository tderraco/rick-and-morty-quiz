# rick-and-morty-quiz
quiz app

Description:
This is my first quiz app utilizing Web API's. I have a created a quiz centered around one of my favorite shows called Rick and Morty. Users are presented with a Intro page to enter into the quiz followed by three questions. Each question gives the user 10 seconds to answer each question and recieve a confirmation whether it is the correct or wrong answer. Each question is worth 5 points for a total of 15 points. A score is generated at the end and the player enter their initials and their score to the score board.

Some of the technologies I used were the use of Event Listeners, if statements, query selectors, functions, and hide and show elements. I found this assignment very challenging. It was tought to get everything working in time. The hide and show elements were the toughtest for me and I was not able to complete them. It took me a long time finding different patterns to use.
