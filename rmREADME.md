  # Description
  This is my first quiz app utilizing Web API's. I have a created a quiz centered around one of my favorite shows called Rick and Morty. Users are presented with a Intro page to enter into the quiz followed by three questions. Each question gives the user 10 seconds to answer each question and recieve a confirmation whether it is the correct or wrong answer.
